<p>1. Churia Tunnel</p>
  <p>The Churia Tunnel, constructed in 1917, holds the distinction of being Nepal's first tunnel and is also considered the first road tunnel in Asia. Located near Hetauda, it was built under the supervision of Colonel Dilli Jung Thapa, Nepal's first civil engineer, to connect Amlekhganj and Bhimphedi through the Chure hills. This 500-meter tunnel was part of the country's first motorable gravel road, facilitating trade between the Indian border and Kathmandu</p>
