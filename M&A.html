<h1>
  History of Merger and Acquisition in Nepal</h1>

<h2>
Merger</h2><p>
A merger is the voluntary fusion of two companies on broadly equal terms into one new legal entity. The firms that agree to merge are roughly equal in terms of size, customers, scale of operations, etc. For this reason, the term "merger of equals" is sometimes used. Acquisitions, unlike mergers, or generally not voluntary and involve one company actively purchasing another.</p><p>
Mergers are most commonly done to gain market share, reduce costs of operations, expand to new territories, unite common products, grow revenues, and increase profits—all of which should benefit the firms' shareholders. After a merger, shares of the new company are distributed to existing shareholders of both original businesses.</p>
<h3>
Types of Mergers</h3>
<h4>
1. Conglomerate Merger</h4>
This is a merger between two or more companies engaged in unrelated business activities. The firms may operate in different industries or in different geographical regions. A pure conglomerate involves two firms that have nothing in common. A mixed conglomerate, on the other hand, takes place between organizations that, while operating in unrelated business activities, are actually trying to gain product or market extensions through the merger.Companies with no overlapping factors will only merge if it makes sense from a shareholder wealth perspective, that is, if the companies can create synergy.<br />
<h4>
2. Congeneric Merger</h4>
A congeneric merger is also known as a Product Extension merger. It occurs when two or more companies join together that operate in the same market or sector with overlapping factors, such as technology, marketing, production processes, and&nbsp;research and development&nbsp;(R&amp;D). A product extension merger is achieved when a new product line from one company is added to an existing product line of the other company. When two companies become one under a product extension, they are able to gain access to a larger group of consumers and, thus, a larger market share.<br />
<h4>
3. Market Extension Merger</h4>
This type of merger occurs between companies that sell the same products but compete in different markets. Companies that engage in a market extension merger seek to gain access to a bigger market and, thus, a bigger client base.<br />
<h4>
4. Horizontal Merger</h4>
A horizontal merger occurs between companies operating in the same industry. The merger is typically part of consolidation between two or more competitors offering the same products or services. Such mergers are common in industries with fewer firms, and the goal is to create a larger business with greater market share and economies of scale since competition among fewer companies tends to be higher.<br />
<h4>
5. Vertical Merger</h4>
When two companies that produce parts or services for a product merger the union is referred to as a vertical merger. A vertical merger occurs when two companies operating at different levels within the same industry's&nbsp;supply chain combine their operations. Such mergers are done to increase synergies achieved through the cost reduction which results from merging with one or more supply companies.<br />
<h3>
 Acquisition</h3>
An acquisition is a situation whereby one company purchases most or all of another company's shares in order to take control. An acquisition occurs when a buying company obtains more than 50% ownership in a target company. As part of the exchange, the acquiring company often purchases the target company's stock and other assets, which allows the acquiring company to make decisions regarding the newly acquired assets without the approval of the target company’s shareholders.<br />
