On the 20th of Chaitra, 2068, its business coverage area was expanded to 10 districts.<br/>Garima Bikas Bank, with a commitment to "Access to All," overcame limited business coverage and service distribution challenges by strategically becoming a National Level Development Bank. Through mergers with erstwhile Nilgiri Bikas Bank Limited on 29th of Asadh 2072 and erstwhile Subekshya Bikas Bank Limited on 4th of Ashwin 2073, the bank strengthened its capital base, expanded branch locations, and improved overall operations. The recent acquisition of Sahara Bikas Bank Limited on 28th of Kartik 2078 further enhances our presence in Province 2. As a result, Garima Bikas Bank has transformed into a robust financial institution, offering a wide range of banking services to a larger customer base and ensuring accessible and reliable banking services across Nepal."
