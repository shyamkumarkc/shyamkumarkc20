Thin walled and consisting of two round metal plates resembling cymbals, ting shaws produce rhythm and are popular in folk and classical music of Nepal. As with the Jhyali, its plates are rubbed with the up-moving right hand and down-moving left simultaneously to produce a clash with almost all other percussion instruments worldwide.These percussion instruments are created from a Nepali alloy known as pancha dhatu, or five metals. Brass, copper, silver, zinc and gold, are mainly of the blacksmith."
