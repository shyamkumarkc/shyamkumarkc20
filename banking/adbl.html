<h1>Agricultural Development Bank Limited </h1>
<p>With the main objective of providing institutional credit for enhancing the production and productivity of the agricultural sector in the country, the&nbsp;<strong>Agricultural Development Bank, Nepal was established in 1968 under the ADBN Act 1967</strong>, as successor to the cooperative Bank. The Land Reform Savings Corporation was merged with ADBN in 1973. Subsequent amendments to the Act empowered the bank to extend credit to small farmers under group liability and expand the scope of financing to promote cottage industries. The amendments also permitted the bank to engage in commercial banking activities for the mobilization of domestic resources.</p>
<p>The bank worked as a premier rural credit institution since its establishment, contributing substantial agricultural credit supply in the country. Rural finance has been the principal operational area of ADBN in the past. However, the bank is also involved in commercial banking operations since 1984, to provide commercial banking services.</p>
<blockquote>The bank has 51% share of Government of Nepal and 49% of general public. Most of its shareholders are customers and employees.</blockquote>
<p>The enactment of&nbsp;<strong>Banks and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA)</strong>&nbsp;took all the&nbsp;<strong>banks and financial institutions (BFIs)</strong>&nbsp;under its umbrella and abolished all the acts related to the<strong>&nbsp;BFIs including the ADBN Act, 1967</strong>. Since then, the bank has been working as a public limited company registered under the Companies Act, 2006 and is licensed as&nbsp;<strong>"A class financial institution"</strong>&nbsp;by Nepal Rastra Bank from 2006.</p>
<p>Having glorious history of more than&nbsp;<strong>53 years,</strong>&nbsp;the bank is one of the leading commercial banks of the country. With its investment in agriculture, industry, trade, commerce and households, the bank has above&nbsp;<strong>1.2 million happily satisfied customers.</strong></p>
<p>Just like its slogan:</p>
<blockquote>"Sampurna Banking Suvidha sahitko Tapai Hamro Ghar Aanganko Bank (The bank with complete banking solution at your own door step)"</blockquote>
<p>it is spread all over the&nbsp;<strong>7 provinces &amp; 77 districts</strong>&nbsp;of the nation with its 278 offices. While providing comprehensive services with complete banking solution, the bank has main motto of promoting rural agriculture, productive and deprived sectors.
