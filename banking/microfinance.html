<h2>Microfinance Companies</h2>
<p>Microfinance companies are financial institutions that provide small-scale financial services—like loans, savings, and insurance—to individuals or groups who typically lack access to traditional banking services.</p>

<p>These companies focus on low-income households, small entrepreneurs, farmers, and women in rural or underserved areas. The goal is to support income-generating activities, reduce poverty, and promote financial inclusion.</p>

<h2>Key Features of Microfinance Companies:</h2>
<ol><li>
Small Loans (Microcredit):<p> They provide very small loans, sometimes just enough to start a small shop, buy seeds, or purchase livestock.<p></li>
<li>No or Minimal Collateral:<p> Unlike banks, they don’t usually require property or large assets as security.<p></li>
<li>Group Lending Models:<p>  Often use group-based lending (e.g., Self-Help Groups or Joint Liability Groups) where members guarantee each other’s loans.<p></li>
<li>Financial Inclusion:<p>  Target people outside the formal banking sector, especially in rural areas.<p></li>
<li>Other Services:<p>  Some also offer savings, insurance, and financial literacy training.<p></li></ol>


<p> In short, microfinance companies act as a bridge between traditional banking and the unbanked poor, empowering them to build small businesses and improve their livelihoods.</p>
