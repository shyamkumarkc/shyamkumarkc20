<h2>Bank Rate</h2>
<p>Bank rate is the rate of interest that is charged on the amount lent by the Central Bank to the banks and financial institutions. Bank rate is the standard rate at which NRB is prepared to buy or rediscount bill of exchange or other eligible commercial paper from banks. It is the basic cost of rediscounting and refinance facilities from NRB. The bank rate is therefore used by NRB to affect the cost and availability of refinance and to change the loanable resources of banks and other financial institutions.</p>

<p>Change in the bank rate by NRB affects the interest rates on loans and deposits in the banking system across the board in the same direction, if not to the same extent. After deregulation and banking reforms since 1989, NRB has gradually loosened its direct regulation of deposit and lending rates and these are left to banks to decide. However, NRB can still affect the interest rated via changes in its bank rate, whenever the situation of the economy warrants it.</p>
