Gold has ability to be pound into thin sheets, a single ounce oif gold can be hammered into 100 square foot sheet. <p>
<p>Pure gold (24 carat) is yellow in color, soft and easily damaged so it is not often used in jewelry, it is alloyed with different metals like copper, silver and zinc to give strength and durability and different proportions of these alloys make different shades of gold red (COPPER, GOLD) or rose gold, white gold (GOLD, NICKEL,ZINC, SILVER, PLATINUM), green gold (GOLD, SILVER, COPPER, ZINC) or yellow gold (GOLD, COPPER, SILVER).</p>
<p>Gold is metal occuring freely in nature. Carat, an indication of gold content in any gold ornament or jewelry, is the basic terminology used for defining and classifing the purity of laymen terms, a 22 carat has around 91.6 % gold and rest is a composition of other metals.</p>
