<h2>Auto Loan</h2>
<p>Auto loan in Nepal refers to a financial product offered by banks and financial institutions in Nepal for an individual or a business to purchase vehicle(s). These loans are available for the purchase of new and used cars, and commercial vehicles.</p>
<h3>Key Features of Auto Loans:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Loan Amount</strong>:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The loan amount typically covers 50% to 90% of the vehicle's price, depending on the bank's policy, the applicant's creditworthiness, and the type of vehicle.</li>
<li>Borrowers are required to make a down payment for the remaining percentage of the vehicle's cost.</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Rates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rates for auto loans in Nepal can vary significantly between banks and financial institutions.</li>
<li>Rates are either fixed or variable, with variable rates being tied to the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) guidelines or the financial institution's base rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repayment Period</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repayment tenure usually ranges from 1 to 7 years, depending on the borrower&rsquo;s preference and the bank&rsquo;s terms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Banks in Nepal charge processing fees for auto loans, which range from 0.5% to 1% of the loan amount.</li>
