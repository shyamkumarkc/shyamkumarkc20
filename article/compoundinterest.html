<h2>Compound Interest (CI)</h2><p>
It is the system or process of calculating the interest where interest receivable or accumulated is added with principle that will give the compound amount and the interest is charged back on that compound amount. The interest amount is higher than the simple interest.</p><p>
Compound interest is a method of calculating interest on a principal amount that takes into account both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. In other words, interest is calculated not only on the original amount but also on the interest that has been added to the principal over time.</p><p>
The compound interest formula is given by:</p><p>
A=P(1+nr)<sup>nt</sup><br/>
where:<br/>
'Amount' A is the future value of the investment or loan, including interest.<br/>
'Principal' P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).<br/>
'Rate' r is the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).<br/>
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t.<br/>
'Time' t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, usually in years.'<br/>
<p>The compound interest formula allows for interest to be compounded over multiple periods, which can lead to exponential growth in the value of the investment.
For example, if you have Rs 1,00,000 as a principal amount, an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded quarterly (n=4), and you invest it for 2 years, the future value (A) can be calculated using the compound interest formula. The calculation would involve quarterly compounding, and the formula would give you the total amount including both the principal and the compounded interest.</p><p>
In contrast to simple interest, compound interest tends to result in higher returns or higher debt over time, as interest is earned or charged not just on the original principal but also on the accumulated interest.</p>
