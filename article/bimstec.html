<p>On 6th June 1997, a new sub regional grouping was formed on Bangkok, Capital city of Thailand. It was given the name BIST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Sri lanka and Thailand Economic Co-operation). Myanmar joined the organization as a full member at a special ministerial meeting held in Bangkok on 22th December 1997, upon which the name of grouping was named to BIMST-EC. Nepal and Bhutan has acquired its membership in 2004 in the first summit on 31st July 2004. The grouping was named BIMSTEC - Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sector Technical and Economic Co-operation.<br /> BIMSTEC is a unique link between ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Countries) and SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation). It is because it has linked South Asia and East Asia. Leadership is rotated in alphabetical order of country names. The permanent secretariat is in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
