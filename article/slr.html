<h2>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)</h2>
<p>Statutory Liquidity Ratio is a provision of reserve requirement set by the central bank to its bank and financial institutions for maintaining some liquidity in the form of cash, government bonds or other convertible assets. It refers to the supplementary liquid reserve requirements of banks in addtion to CRR. At present, NRB has provisioned SLR 10% of their total domestic deposit liabilities for commercial banks.</p>
<br/>
<p>SLR has three objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>To restrict expansion of banks' credit,</li>
<li>To ensure liquidity of banks and</li>
<li>To increase banks' investment in approved securities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of an increase in SLR by Nepal Rastra Bank is the reduction in the lending capacity of banks by pre-empting a certain portion of their DTL for government or other approved securities. It has a deflationary impact on the economy, not only by reducing the supply of loanable funds of banks but also by increasing the lending rates in the face of an increasing demand for bank credit and viceversa.</p>
