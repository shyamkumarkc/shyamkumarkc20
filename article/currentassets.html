<h2>Current Assets</h2>
<p>The Current Assets account is a balance sheet line item listed under the Assets section, which accounts for all company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one year. Assets whose value is recorded in the Current Assets account are considered current assets.</p>
<p>Current assets include&nbsp;cash, cash equivalents,&nbsp;accounts receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, pre-paid liabilities, and other&nbsp;liquid assets. Current Assets may also be called Current Accounts.</p>
<p>Publicly-owned companies must adhere to generally accepted accounting principles and reporting procedures. Following these principles and practices, financial statements must be generated with specific line items that create transparency for interested parties. One of these statements is the balance sheet, which lists a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.</p>
<p>Current Assets is always the first account listed in a company's balance sheet under the Assets section. It is comprised of sub-accounts that make up the Current Assets account.1&nbsp;For example, Apple, Inc. lists several sub-accounts under Current Assets that combine to make up total current assets, which is the value of all Current Assets sub-accounts.</p>
<h2>Types of Current Assets</h2>
<p>Many assets can be considered current by different businesses throughout all industries. In general, most industries group their current assets into these sub-accounts; however, you might see others:2</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash and Cash Equivalents</li>
<li>Marketable Securities</li>
<li>Accounts Receivable</li>
<li>Inventory</li>
<li>Prepaid Liabilities/Expenses</li>
<li>Other Short-Term Investments</li>
</ul>
<p>On the balance sheet, the Current Asset sub-accounts are normally displayed in order of current asset liquidity. The assets most easily converted into cash are ranked higher by the finance division or accounting firm that prepared the report. The order in which these accounts appear might differ because each business can account for the included assets differently.</p>
<h3>Cash and Cash Equivalents</h3>
<p>By definition, assets in the Current Assets account are cash or can be quickly converted to cash. Cash equivalents are certificates of deposit, money market funds, short-term government bonds, and treasury bills.3</p>
<p>To qualify as current assets, these items must not have any restrictions that inhibit their short-term liquidity.</p>
<h3>Marketable Securities</h3>
<p>Marketable Securities is the account where the total value of liquid investments that can be quickly converted to cash without reducing their market value is entered.4&nbsp;For example, if shares of a company trade in very low volumes, it may not be possible to convert them to cash without impacting their market value. These shares would not be considered liquid and, therefore, would not have their value entered into the Current Assets account.</p>
<h3>Accounts Receivable</h3>
<p>Accounts Receivable&mdash;the value of all money due to a company for goods or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers&mdash;is entered in Current Assets as long as the accounts can be expected to be paid within a year.5&nbsp;If a business makes sales by offering&nbsp;longer credit terms to its customers, some of its receivables may not be included in the Current Assets account.</p>
<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p>Inventory&mdash;which represents raw materials, components, and finished products&mdash;is included in the Current Assets account.6&nbsp;However, different accounting methods can adjust inventory; at times, it may not be as liquid as other qualified current assets depending on the product and the industry sector.</p>
<h3>Prepaid Liabilities</h3>
<p>Prepaid expenses&mdash;which represent advance payments made by a company for goods and services to be received in the future&mdash;are considered current assets. Although they cannot be converted into cash, they are payments already made. These payments&nbsp;free up capital for other uses. Prepaid expenses might include payments to insurance companies or contractors.</p>
<h3>Other Short-Term Investments</h3>
<p>Many companies categorize liquid investments into the Marketable Securities account, but some can be accounted for in the Other Short-Term Investments account. An example would be excess funds invested in a short-term security, putting the funds to work but keeping the option of accessing them if needed.</p>
<h2>Formula for Current Assets</h2>
<p>The total current assets formulation is a simple summation of all the assets that can be converted to cash within one year. If a current asset subcategory is not listed in this formula, you can add it to Other Liquid Assets. You gather the current asset information from a balance sheet and add it. Typically, it is already totaled up for you on the balance sheet under Total Current Assets:</p>
<p>Current&nbsp;Assets&nbsp;=&nbsp;C&nbsp;+&nbsp;CE&nbsp;+&nbsp;I&nbsp;+&nbsp;AR&nbsp;+&nbsp;MS&nbsp;+&nbsp;PE&nbsp;+&nbsp;OLA</p>
<p>where:C&nbsp;=&nbsp;Cash</p>
<p>CE&nbsp;=&nbsp;Cash&nbsp;Equivalents</p>
<p>I&nbsp;=&nbsp;Inventory</p>
<p>AR&nbsp;=&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;Receivable</p>
<p>MS&nbsp;=&nbsp;Marketable&nbsp;Securities</p>
<p>PE&nbsp;=&nbsp;Prepaid&nbsp;Expenses</p>
<p>OLA&nbsp;=&nbsp;Other&nbsp;Liquid&nbsp;Assets</p>
