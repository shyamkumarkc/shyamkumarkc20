<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Open ended Mutual Fund

<p>Open ended mutual fund has an infinite life which means that there is no ending date of this scheme. This scheme can continue to go on forever and due to this factor scheme allows investors to come and go with some conditions. The advantage of these scheme is that investor can put additional money into the scheme or exit as per their wish.</p>
</li>

<li>Close ended Mutual Fund</li>
  <p>&nbsp;Close ended mutual fund schemes are those schemes that will come to an end after a specific period of time. After the specific time period, all the assets of schemes are sold off and these are distributed to the unit holders after deducting the necessary expenses for the entire process. Close ended mutual funds are listed on the stock exchange where investors can buy units from others via secondary market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fund size differs from scheme to scheme however the total units issued by the scheme remains the same as the fund will not issue any additional units after initial offering.</p>

<p>A scheme can be classified as Growth fund, Income fund or Balanced fund considering its investment objective.</p>
<h3>Growth/Equity Oriented Scheme</h3>
<p>The objective of growth scheme is to provide capital appreciation over medium to long term period. Such schemes normally invest a major part of their corpus in equities. These schemes are comparatively higher risky which provide different options to the investors like divided option, capital appreciation and investors may choose an option depending on their preferences.</p>
<h3>Income/Debt Oriented Scheme</h3>
<p>The aim of income scheme is to provide regular and steady income to investors. These schemes generally invest in fixed income securities such as bonds, corporate debentures, government securities and money market instruments which are less risky compared to equity scheme.</p>
